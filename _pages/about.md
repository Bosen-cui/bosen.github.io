I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the National University of Singapore, under the guidance of Professors Jialiang Li and Charumathi Sabanayagam. My research interests lie in semiparametric statistics, model averaging, and model selection.

Prior to my Ph.D. studies in Singapore, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Statistics from Harbin Institute of Technology.
